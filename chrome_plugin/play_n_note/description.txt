Description

Play n Note

This plugin is for taking notes while watching Coursera videos.

Features -
1. As you start to take notes, the video pauses. You can take your time to put down your thoughts. As you press Enter, the video resumes.

2. You can take note as you find any interesting point to make.

3. As each note gets saved, there is a timestamp associated. This timestamp is clickable - with which you can browse through the video. You can go back and forth to any interesting point that you note.

4. This extension uses Google authentication only once as you visit any video lectures list. After that you can go to any class video and a notes window would be presented.

5. If you don't like a note, it can be deleted any time. 

6. The notes can be moved any time to any part of the screen.
